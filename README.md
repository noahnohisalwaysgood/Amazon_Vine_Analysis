# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine program:
* Analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results:

I created the data and transformed to 4 diferent data tables based on the Amazon Reviews Pet Supplies dataset.

## Summary:
99% of the positive reviews are from non-Vine reviews. However, no positve from the Vine Program. As a result, there is no evidence to suggest that the Vine reviews contain any positivity bias.
